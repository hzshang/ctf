;;; Commentary:
;; Major mode for the mix asm language.
;; The mix asm language is described in "The Art Of Computer Programming".
;;
;; For optimal use, also use GNU MDK. Compiling needs mixasm, running
;; and debugging needs mixvm and mixvm.el from GNU MDK. You can get
;; GNU MDK from `https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/mdk/' and
;; `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/mdk'.
;;
;; To use this mode, place the following in your .emacs file:
;; `(load-file "/PATH-TO-FILE/mixal-mode.el")'.
;; When you load a file with the extension .mixal the mode will be started
;; automatic. If you want to start the mode manual, use `M-x mixal-mode'.
;; Font locking will work, the behavior of tabs is the same as emacs
;; default behavior. You can compile a source file with `C-c c' you can
;; run a compiled file with `C-c r' or run it in debug mode with `C-c d'.
;; You can get more information about a particular operation code by using
;; mixal-describe-operation-code or `C-h o'.
;;
;; Have fun.

;;; History:
;; Version 0.3:
;; 08/10/05: sync mdk and emacs cvs
;;           from emacs: compile-command and require-final-newline
;;           from mdk:   see version 0.2
;;           correct my email address
;; Version 0.2:
;; 06/04/05: mixasm no longer needs -g option
;;           fontlocking of comments works in all? cases now
;;           added some more mixal-operation-codes
;; Version 0.1:
;; Version 0.1.1:
;; 22/11/02: bugfix in fontlocking, needed to add a '-' to the regex.
;; 19/11/02: completed implementing mixal-describe-operation-code.
;; 13/11/02: implemented compile, mixal-run and mixal-debug.
;; 10/11/02: implemented font-locking and syntax table.
;; 09/11/02: started mixal-mode.
